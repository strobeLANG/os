# Strobe Operating System
The Strobe Operating System is a Cosmos-based operating system that will support loading and executing of DIF executables that are generated by the Strobe Compiler.
Currently the operating system isn't working because there are some issues with Cosmos and when they will get resolved we will be able to continue with the development of the Strobe Programming Language and the Strobe Operating System.

The project is seperated into a few submodules.

| Submodule | Description | Status | Format |
| :-------: | ----------- | :----: | :----: |
| [core](//github.com/StrobeOS/core) | The kernel and core features of the operating system. | Under Development | `.bin` |
| [cosmos](//github.com/StrobeOS/cosmos) | A fork of the Cosmos project that works with the core. | Needs Work | `.msi` |
| [strobe](//github.com/StrobeOS/strobe) | The Strobe programming language, Compiler and Runtime. | Needs Work | `.dll` |
| [lib](//github.com/StrobeOS/lib) | The libraries used by the Strobe programming language. | Working OK | `.str` |
| *system* | The beggining of the operating system. | Planned | `.dif` |
| *graphic* | The graphical core of the operating system. | Planned | `.dif` |
